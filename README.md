# Cplusplus-Program
This program is used to see compound interest over a specific number of years with and without a monthly deposit. The user can modify the initial amount, monthly
deposit, number of years invested, and annual percentage of return. 
## What I learned
This project helped me learn more about industry regulations and best practices. The way the files are set up, variables are named, and comments are placed makes the
program more readable. Having minimal code in the main along with a header and cpp file makes the program more maintainable and adaptable. I will continue to practice
these regulations and best practices and they should be transferable to future projects.<br />
